The start-menu depends on Gtk+-2.0, and nothin' else.

To compile, do
$ make

To install ( locally, does NOT need root permission )
$ make install


NOTE: Please DO NOT INSTALL AS ROOT. The start-menu is
designed to work locally for individual users. Install
only as the user you want to use it as. We do not take
the name of root in vain.

To run, do
$ start-menu

To popup menu, do
$ killall -SIGUSR1 start-menu
